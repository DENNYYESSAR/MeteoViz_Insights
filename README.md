Introduction
Welcome to MeteoViz, a web application that brings weather data to life through interactive visualizations. MeteoViz aims to provide users with real-time and historical weather data in an intuitive and visually appealing manner. This project was developed as part of my portfolio at Holberton School, and I'm excited to share the journey and the technical challenges overcome along the way.

Project Inspiration and Journey
MeteoViz was inspired by my passion for technology and data visualization. As a bioengineering graduate, I have always been fascinated by the power of data to reveal patterns and insights. This project allowed me to combine my bioengineering background with my software engineering skills, creating a tool that makes weather data accessible and engaging for everyone.

Technical Challenges
One of the most significant technical challenges I faced was integrating the MySQL database with the front end. Ensuring seamless data flow between the backend and front end required careful configuration of API endpoints and data synchronization. I spent countless hours debugging and optimizing the data retrieval processes to provide users with a smooth experience.

Technology Stack
Frontend: React, D3.js
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MySQL
API: OpenWeatherMap API
Key Features
Interactive Weather Maps:
Visualize real-time weather updates with interactive maps.
Historical Weather Data:
Access and analyze past weather trends for any location.
User Profiles:
Create and manage personalized weather alerts and saved locations.
Learnings and Future Iterations
Through this project, I reinforced my understanding of full-stack development, API integration, and data visualization. I learned the importance of thorough planning and testing, especially when dealing with real-time data. In the next iteration, I plan to enhance the application's performance and add more detailed weather analytics features.
